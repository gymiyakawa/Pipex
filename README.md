# PIPEX 

This is a project for 42QC school.

### Summary:

This project will let you discover in detail a UNIX mechanism that you   already know by using it in your program.

### Instructions:

	$ make
	$ ./pipex infile cmd1 cmd2 outfile

 Any errors should be handled the same 
 way the bash command would.

 	< infile cmd1 | cmd2 > outfile 

should have the same output and behavior as calling this program.

#### Other make options

	$ make re
	$ make clean
	$ make fclean
